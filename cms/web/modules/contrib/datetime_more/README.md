# Datetime More Widget

The "Datetime More Widget" module solves 3 problems:

1. Allows the user to independently specify the minimum and maximum year
   0001-9999. (In the datetime module, the year selection is limited to
   1900-2050)
1. Allows the user to use the Select list or Number field to enter date and
   time values.
1. Adds input for seconds (Seconds were missing from the datetime widget).

The module adds a date and time input widget with an extended date range.
This can be useful for scientific, historical, and astronomical projects.
